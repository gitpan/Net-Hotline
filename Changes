    * Using the macbinary() method to convert files with no data fork to
      MacBinary II format now works correctly.

    * Miscellaneous code style changes, mostly involving variable scope
      and importing.

    * Fixed a path translation bug in the "mput" command in "hlftp.pl"

0.63 (09.09.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added tracker() and tracker_list() methods.

    * Fixed connection timeouts and tweaked a few error messages.

    * Fixed failure return value in several functions: changed
      return(undef) to return to ensure correctness regardless
      of scalar or array context.

    * Squashed minor bugs in hlftp.pl.

0.62 (08.01.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Fixed a bug in the network write routine that caused it to croak
      during large transfers.

    * Added an "mput" command (and miscellaneous bug fixes) to "hlftp.pl"

    * Changed the Mac OS installation instructions in the REAMDE file to
      avoid problems with AutoLoader in MacPerl.

0.61 (07.21.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Fixed missing argument to substr() in User.pm (doh!)

0.60 (07.20.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added file upload.

    * Enabled real dual-forked Mac file creation when downloading on
      Mac OS systems.

    * Blocking task mode introduced, along with a handful of blocking
      methods.

    * Overhauled error handling to work with the new blocking task mode.

    * Changed the network i/o (again).

    * Kludged up a bunch of function names to prevent AutoLoader from
      complaining about non-unique 8-letter(!) names.

    * Made a few modules less intrusive with their exporting.

    * Fixed a bug that caused CPAN.pm and other modules that use ExtUtils
      to find version numbers to die with an eval() error.

    * Changed the README to prevent hapless Mac OS users from overwriting
      MacPerl's lib/Net/ directory.

    * Included two example scripts: hlftp.pl and hibot.pl

    * In case you're wondering, I don't expect the API to completely
      stabilize until version 1.0.

0.51 (07.04.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added file download and MacBinary II conversion.

    * News handler routines now make sense.

    * Client.pm grew large enough for me to start autoloading stuff.

    * Overhauled network reading routines to handle disconnects more
      gracefully and be robust enough to do file transfers.

    * Renamed a bunch of constants in Net::Hotline::Constants.

0.50 (06.23.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Initial release.
