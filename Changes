Revision history for Perl module Net::Hotline

0.60 (07.20.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added file upload.

    * Enabled real dual-forked Mac file creation when downloading on
      Mac OS systems.

    * Blocking task mode introduced, along with a handful of blocking
      methods.

    * Overhauled error handling to work with the new blocking task mode.

    * Changed the network i/o (again).

    * Kludged up a bunch of function names to prevent AutoLoader from
      complaining about non-unique 8-letter(!) names.

    * Made a few modules less intrusive with their exporting.

    * Fixed a bug that caused CPAN.pm and other modules that use ExtUtils
      to find version numbers to die with an eval() error.

    * Changed the README to prevent hapless Mac OS users from overwriting
      MacPerl's lib/Net/ directory.

    * Included two example scripts: hlftp.pl and hibot.pl

    * In case you're wondering, I don't expect the API to completely
      stabilize until version 1.0.

0.51 (07.04.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Added file download and MacBinary II conversion.

    * News handler routines now make sense.

    * Client.pm grew large enough for me to start autoloading stuff.

    * Overhauled network reading routines to handle disconnects more
      gracefully and be robust enough to do file transfers.

    * Renamed a bunch of constants in Net::Hotline::Constants.

0.50 (06.23.1998) - John Siracusa <siracusa@mindspring.com>

    * Initial release.
