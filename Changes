    * Added file download and MacBinary II conversion.

    * News handler routines now make sense.

    * Client.pm grew large enough for me to start autoloading stuff.

    * Overhauled network reading routines to handle disconnects more
      gracefully and be robust enough to do file transfers.

    * Renamed a bunch of constants in Net::Hotline::Constants.
