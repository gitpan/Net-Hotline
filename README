DESCRIPTION

The Net::Hotline modules implement a Hotline interface in Perl.  Currently,
this includes only Hotline::Client.  Hotline is an internet client/server
system that's a sort of cross between IRC and a BBS.  See
http://www.hotlinesw.com/ for more information.

PREREQUISITES

Net::Hotline has only been tested on perl version 5.004_03 and MacPerl
5.2.0r4.  It should work fine on any version of Perl 5, however.  You'll
need to install the IO:: modules (for IO::Socket, etc.) if you have an
older Perl distribution that didn't include them.  You'll also probably
want to upgrade to the latest version if your IO:: modules are not up to
date.

CHANGES

Version 0.60 was the first (nearly) feature-complete release.  It had a
significant bug in User.pm, and version 0.61 was released a day later.
See the "Changes" file for more details.

INSTALLATION

The standard incantations should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Here are a few common variations on that theme:

* If you don't want to (or can't) install in the system-wide directories,
  you can use PREFIX to install elsewhere.  Example:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
	make
	make install

  You'll probably have to create some dummy directories before this works.
  Just look at the error messages and create the directories it says it
  can't find.

* If you're installing on a Mac OS system, simply duplicate the folder
  hierarchy inside the distribution's "lib" folder in your MacPerl folder.
  For example, "lib/Net/Hotline/Protocol/Packet.pm" would be copied to
  "<Your MacPerl Folder>/lib/Net/Hotline/Protocol/Packet.pm"  (You'll have
  to create any nonexistent folders in the path)

EXAMPLES

There are two example scripts in the "Examples" directory.

1. "hlftp.pl" is a simple command line FTP-like Hotline client included
   to demonstrate Net::Hotline::Client's "blocking task mode" (read the
   documentation for an explanation).  Its operation should be familiar
   to anyone who's used ncftp or the regular Unix ftp client.

2. "hibot.pl" is a very simple Hotline "bot" included to demonstrate
   Net::Hotline::Client's "event loop mode" (again, RTFM).  It works a
   lot like hlftp.pl in terms of connecting to servers.  Log the bot
   onto your local Hotline server an message it with the text "help"
   for more information.
