DESCRIPTION

The Net::Hotline modules implement a Hotline interface in Perl.  Currently,
this includes only Hotline::Client.  Hotline is an internet client/server
system that's a sort of cross between IRC and a BBS.  See
http://www.hotlinesw.com/ for more information.

PREREQUISITES

You'll need to install the IO:: modules (for IO::Socket, etc.) if you have
an older Perl distribution that didn't include them.  You'll also probably
want to upgrade to the latest version if your IO:: modules are not up to
date.

INSTALLATION

The standard incantations should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Here are a few common variations on that theme:

* If you don't want to or can't install in the system-wide directories,
  you can use PREFIX to install elsewhere.  Example:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
	make
	make install

  You'll probably have to create some dummy directories before this works.
  Just look at the error messages and create the directories it says it
  can't find.

* If you're installing on a Mac OS system, the simplest way to get going
  is to drag the entire contents of the "lib" folder into the "lib" folder
  in your MacPerl folder.
