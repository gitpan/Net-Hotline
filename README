DESCRIPTION

The Net::Hotline modules implement a Hotline interface in Perl.  Currently,
this includes only Hotline::Client.  Hotline is an internet client/server
system that's a sort of cross between IRC and a BBS.  See
http://www.hotlinesw.com/ for more information.

PREREQUISITES

Net::Hotline has only been tested on perl version 5.004_03 and MacPerl
5.2.0r4.  It should work fine on any version of Perl 5, however.  You'll
need to install the IO:: modules (for IO::Socket, etc.) if you have an
older Perl distribution that didn't include them.  You'll also probably
want to upgrade to the latest version if your IO:: modules are not up to
date.

CHANGES

Version 0.64 fixes a bug involving converting files with no data fork to
MacBinary II format, corrects file path translation in "hlftp.pl", and
includes a few internal variable scoping and code style changes.  See the
"Changes" file for more details.

INSTALLATION

The standard incantations should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Here are a few common variations on that theme:

* If you don't want to (or can't) install in the system-wide directories,
  you can use PREFIX to install elsewhere.  Example:

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~
	make
	make install

  You'll probably have to create some dummy directories before this works.
  Just look at the error messages and create the directories it says it
  can't find.

* If you're installing on a Mac OS system, simply duplicate the folder
  hierarchy inside the distribution's "lib" folder in your MacPerl folder.
  For example, "lib/Net/Hotline/Protocol/Packet.pm" would be copied to
  "<Your MacPerl Folder>/lib/Net/Hotline/Protocol/Packet.pm"  (You'll have
  to create any nonexistent folders in the path)

  I'm not sure how to AutoSplit in MacPerl, so what I've been doing is
  commenting out two lines in "Client.pm" to disable AutoLoading.  The
  lines are:

          30: require AutoLoader;
        1310: __END__

  Just add a "#" character to the beginning of those lines.

EXAMPLES

There are two example scripts in the "Examples" directory.

1. "hlftp.pl" is a simple command line FTP-like Hotline client included
   to demonstrate Net::Hotline::Client's "blocking task mode" (read the
   documentation for an explanation).  Its operation should be familiar
   to anyone who's used ncftp or the regular Unix ftp client.

2. "hibot.pl" is a very simple Hotline "bot" included to demonstrate
   Net::Hotline::Client's "event loop mode" (again, RTFM).  It works a
   lot like hlftp.pl in terms of connecting to servers.  Log the bot
   onto your local Hotline server an message it with the text "help"
   for more information.
